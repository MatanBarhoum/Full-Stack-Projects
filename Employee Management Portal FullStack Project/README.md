# Employees Management Web Portal (CRUD) FullStack Project

<h2>Front End</h2>
Angular 10 <br> After I fell in love with HTML, CSS and JS I decided to try diffrent things. Angular for Front-End was a mandatory. As this is my first step into the world of angular, I got to say that Angular is quite hard to understand, but the hardest, the better.
<h2>Back-End</h2>
For the Web API I decided to go with .Net (C#) as I am more familiar with .Net and C#.
<h2>Database</h2>
I decided to go with SQL Server because my company work with SQL Server and after so many years in the section of Private Server Games (Maplestory, Wow, CS 1.6) I decided to abandon the MYSQL for a while :)
